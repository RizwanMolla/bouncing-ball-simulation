Bouncing Ball Simulation with Gravity! ðŸŽ®

Excited to share my latest project built with Python and Pygame: a dynamic Bouncing Ball Simulation. This project showcases:

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

Gravity-Driven Motion: The ball's realistic movement simulates the effect of gravity.
Boundary Collision: The ball bounces off the circular boundary with perfect reflection.
Sound Effects: Adds immersive collision sound for a more engaging experience.

ðŸ’» Learning Outcomes:

Improved understanding of physics simulation and boundary detection.
Hands-on experience with event handling, animations, and sound integration in Pygame.
Enhanced problem-solving while debugging and refining the motion and collision logic.
